As with kicker, cards with aftermath have a primary effect and a secondary optional effect that can be produced by paying an additional cost. As with flashback, the second effect can be cast from the graveyard at a time of the player&#39;s choosing. Aftermath appears in Amonkhet in all five colors, at rarities of uncommon and above.</p>

			<p>The term bury or buried was used in some early sets, where it served as shorthand for a two-part effect: destroying a permanent, and preventing that permanent from regenerating. It is still functionally present in the game, with newer cards using a complete explanation for each part of the effect. (e.g. &#34;Destroy target creature. It cannot be regenerated.&#34;)[32] Bury is found only in sets prior to Tempest; all cards which contained the term have been issued new wording to use either a &#34;destroy&#34; or &#34;sacrifice&#34; effect.</p>

			<p>This ability is written Embalm (cost) and appears on creature cards. When a card with this ability is in a player&#39;s graveyard, that player may pay its embalm cost to exile the card and put a token into play that is a zombie copy of the creature, in addition to the creature&#39;s other creature types (e.g., a Zombie Angel instead of an Angel).[5]: 156  This allows a player to gain a second use from a card with benefits from other cards that interact with zombie creatures. Embalm is an activated ability (the token is created, not cast) and may be played only when the player could cast a sorcery.[5]: 156  This keyword is similar to flashback, but is found on creature cards rather than instant and sorcery cards. Embalm appears in Amonkhet, primarily appears on blue and white cards. Each card with embalm has its own printed token card, with an alternate artwork showing a mummified version of the original creature.</p>

			<p>This ability is written Fortify (cost). It is found only on fortifications, a subtype of artifacts. A player pays the fortify cost as a sorcery (only during their own main phase when the stack is empty) and attaches it to a land they control. That land becomes &#34;fortified&#34; and can then be referenced by the fortification as the &#34;fortified land&#34;. Other than attaching to lands instead of creatures, the rules for fortifications are similar to those for equipment.[5]: 50, 51, 144  Fortify appears on a single timeshifted artifact from Future Sight, Darksteel Garrison.</p>

			<p>Regenerate represented two related keyword actions. An ability such as &#34;Regenerate [this creature]&#34; could be activated; in this context &#34;regenerate&#34; means &#34;set up a regeneration shield&#34;, which protects the affected permanent from the next time it would be destroyed (either due to damage or to &#34;destroy&#34; effects). Instead of being destroyed, the permanent would become tapped and be removed from combat. The second keyword action refers to when this actually occurs: cards like Skeleton Scavengers have a delayed triggered ability that only triggers when the creature has a destroy effect prevented by its regeneration ability. This ability was generally found on creatures, though any permanent can be regenerated.</p>

These cards were all enchantments that could be played as instants, but only lasted for one turn if played as an instant. Under the newer rules, the original wording would cause the enchantment to leave the battlefield before damage was removed from creatures. The creation of substance restored the cards&#39; intended functionality.[37] With the rule changes announced in July 2009,[38] all cards edited to use this keyword were re-edited to no longer use it. The official text of such cards now refers to the cleanup step explicitly. This maintained the same functionality as the substance keyword, but without some unintended rules quirks.</p>

			<p>ypecycling is a variant of cycling that is worded (card type) cycling (cost). When the ability is used the player discards the card, then may search their deck for any card containing the indicated subtype and put it in their hand.[5]: 135  It first appeared in Scourge as &#34;Landcycling&#34;, indicating cards which could search for basic lands. Typecycling was redefined with the release of Future Sight to allow searching for other types of cards, and also appears in Alara block. Typecycling activates anything that would trigger on cycling.</p>

			<p>To untap a permanent is to return it to a vertical orientation, allowing it to be tapped again. A tapped permanent must be untapped before it can be tapped again. However, as introduced in the Shadowmoor block, untapping can also be a cost for activated abilities. It has its own special untap symbol (often called &#34;Q&#34;), and is separate from normal untapping. To pay a cost including the untap symbol, the permanent must be already tapped. If that permanent is also a creature, then, as with the tap symbol, that ability can only be used if the creature has been under its controller&#39;s control since the beginning of their most recent turn.</p>
