/* This file is for global (sitewide) attributes.
 * If you need to change something that only affects a specific page, then use/make a separate CSS file.
 * 
 * This is to keep file sizes smaller and help with organization.



 * We are using mobile-first design. This means it needs to work first on a small screen (by width), then extra css is applied as the viewport width crosses certain points.

 * We are utilizing Bootstrap (CSS & JS) and Popper
